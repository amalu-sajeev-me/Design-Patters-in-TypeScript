Write cleaner code and enhance your development skills with TypeScript design patterns

## what does SOLID mean
*   S = single Responsibility
*   O = Open/Close
*   L = Liskov Substituition
*   I = Interface Segregation
*   D = Dependancy Inversion

### Single responsibility

A class should be responsible for a single purpose

### Open/Close

open to extension and closed to modification

### Liskov Substituition

also known as substituitability. Younshould be able to use a sub class in place of it's Parent class.

### Interface Segregation

A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement

### Dependancy Inversion

your classes and modules should not depend on Abstractions instead of concrete implementations
